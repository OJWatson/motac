# SCOPE

This repository is managed under OpenClaw Portfolio OS.

## Operational sources of truth

- Source of truth for next work: `docs/agent/NEXT_TASKS.md`
- Source of truth for state: `docs/agent/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- Source of truth for completed tasks: `docs/agent/TRACE.md`

## Milestone scope notes (M0/M1)

- **M0 (reset + schema):** canonical event schema + validation tests + a stable repo layout.
- **M1 (substrate cache artefacts v1):** deterministic cache bundle format + provenance + documentation.

If a task starts drifting into “new feature work” (loaders, full workflows,
forecasting), it should be tracked as a later milestone and not forced into
M0/M1 clean-up work.
