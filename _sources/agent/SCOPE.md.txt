# SCOPE

This repository is managed under OpenClaw Portfolio OS.

## Operational sources of truth

- Source of truth for next work: `docs/agent/NEXT_TASKS.md`
- Source of truth for state: `docs/agent/PROJECT_STATE.md`
- Source of truth for completed tasks: `docs/agent/TRACE.md`

## Milestone scope notes (M0/M1)

Canonical DoD / scope guard rails for M0/M1 live in:

- `docs/agent/MILESTONES_M0_M1.md`

If a task starts drifting beyond that, move it to a later milestone instead of
forcing it into M0/M1.
