      "Added Hawkes prediction API: predict_hawkes_intensity_one_step (given history)",
      "Added Hawkes prediction API: predict_hawkes_intensity_multi_step (expected-count roll-forward)",
      "Exported predict functions from motac.sim",
      "Added unit tests covering one-step match to simulator intensity, multi-step consistency, alpha=0 -> mu",

  "remainingTodo": [
    "CI run confirmation on GitHub for commit 3481130 (should be green if workflows unchanged)",
    "Consider aligning naming between likelihood.hawkes_intensity and hawkes.predict_* (optionally unify via a shared helper)",
    "Consider adding a stochastic multi-step forecast option (simulate future counts) alongside deterministic expected-intensity forecast"
